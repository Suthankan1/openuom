# Simple Calculator Python Project

This repository contains a simple calculator project implemented in Python for a course-level programming assignment. The objective of this project is to extend the functionality of the calculator to save and display past results of arithmetic operations.

## Objectives

Extend the functionality of the calculator to save and display the past results of arithmetic operations.

### Stage 2: Save and display calculation history of the calculator

In this second stage of the assignment, you will extend the given calculator program to record the calculations and recall them as a list using an additional command '?'.

#### Task 1: Study the given code and extend it to save each executed operation in a Python List.

- Declare a list to store the previous operations.
- Save the operator, operands, and the results as a single string for each operation after each calculation.

#### Task 2: Implement a history() function to handle the operation '?'.

- Display the complete saved list of operations (in the order of execution) using a new command ‘?’.
- If there are no previous calculations when the history '?' command is used, display the following message: "No past calculations to show".

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply run the `calculator.py` script in your Python environment.

### Commands

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- History: `?`
